# Antimatter Chemistry - LTS Version

Welcome to the LTS (long term support) version of [Antimatter Chemistry](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/antimatter-chemistry) a popular modpack I've been maintaining for the past 3 years. It still has a somewhat stable player base and I decided to support the pack and keep it as polished as possible. Sadly we collected quite a few bugs and issues over the past few years, so to finally settle most of them I decided to create this version of the pack. It tries to finish most of its loose ends, improve the overall progression, while still maximizing performance and allow the pack to be played by as many people as possible.

## Where it all started

I created the first update of Antimatter Chemistry on the 7th May 2022. This was version 1.3.0, which was published shortly after. Since then I released another 20 updates, while still collecting all issues users encountered and simultaneously fixing countless ones. So roughly 100k downloads after taking over the pack I think it's time to finally evolve the pack into something that future proofs its maintainability.

## What are our plans?

I already talked quite extensively about my plans with the pack in [this issue](https://github.com/SmashingMods/antimatter-chemistry/issues/389). The first step was to fork the 1.12.2 version of [Alchemistry](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alchemistry), which is one of the main mods of the pack and polish it, so it can play an even bigger role in the LTS version. We already finished this step and released [Alchemistry-Redox](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alchemistry-redox). Which features new textures, fancier GUIs, overall bugfixes and various smaller improvements.

## Is it finished yet?

No. At least not _yet_. We just starting on the actual development of the LTS version and I know from previous projects, even if it looks like smooth sailing, we'll definitely encounter various issues eventually. So stay tuned for further updates. Oh one last thing - want to contribute, help development or play test?
